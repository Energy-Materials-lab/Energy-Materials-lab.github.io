## Brief biography

Nageh Allam received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from Pennsylvania State University and pursued postdoctoral studies at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He joined AUC as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2011 and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2015, later advancing to Professor of Physics. His multidisciplinary research sits at the interface of nanoscience, physics, and chemistry, developing well‑designed nanostructured materials with controlled composition, size, and shape for energy conversion and storage, sensors, biomedical applications, and more. His work spans both experimental and theoretical activities. Allam is a member of APS, American Nano Society, MRS, ECS, ASTM International, and the Max Planck Society, and is a recent electee to the Arab‑German Young Academy of Sciences and Humanities (AGYA). He has published more than 100 papers in reputed peer‑reviewed journals and over 90 conference articles, and serves on editorial boards of several renowned journals. His honors include the Ford Foundation International Graduate Fellowship, RAK‑CAM Postdoctoral Fellowship, TWAS Young Scientist Award, Showman Foundation Award in Applied Sciences, the State of Egypt Award in Advanced Technological Sciences, and the AUC Excellence in Research and Creative Endeavors Award.
